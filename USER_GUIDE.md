### Today <a name="today"></a></br>
This is a function to fetch assumed today's date - date that is stored in the file `./date`. Date is always stored in YYYY-MM-DD format (across the whole project too btw). Use it as below:
`python3 main.py date today` </br>
which should give you a result like: </br>
`We assume that today is 2024-01-07.`
